#  SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
#  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

#  Solution:
#  This is a syntax error saying that on line 2 (in irb)
#  we are missing a closing curly brace after a closing round one
#  OR we used a closing round brace instead of a curly one.
