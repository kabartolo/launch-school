    <h1>Mad Libs</h1>
    <h2>January 17, 2018</h2>
    <p>Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.</p>

    <p>Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.</p>

    <script>
      var noun = prompt('Enter a noun:');
      var verb = prompt('Enter a verb:');
      var adj = prompt('Enter an adjective:');
      var adv = prompt('Enter an adverb:');

      console.log(`Do you ${verb} your ${adj} ${noun} ${adv}? That's hilarious!`);
      console.log(`The ${adj} ${noun} ${verb}s ${adv} over the lazy dog.`);
      console.log(`The ${noun} ${adv} ${verb}s up ${adj} Joe's turtle.`);
