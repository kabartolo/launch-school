      // Why doesn't the following program work and how can it be fixed?
      var person = { name: 'Victor' };
      var otherPerson = { name: 'Victor' }; // object literal creates a new object

      console.log(person === otherPerson);    // false -- expected: true

      // The otherPerson variable is assigned to a new object. It has the same value as the first object,
      // but it is not the same object. The === operator will only return true if the two objects are the same.

      // The following fixes it:

      var person = { name: 'Victor' };
      var otherPerson = person; // the reference to the above object is assigned to this variable

      console.log(person === otherPerson);  // true
