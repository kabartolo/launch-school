# 120 OOP: Lesson 4: Exercises: Easy 2  (28 May 2017)
# Question 10

# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby?
# Think of as many as you can.



# Because there are so many benefits to using OOP we will just summarize some of the major ones:

#     Creating objects allow programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
#     Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
#     It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
#     It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
#     We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
#     As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
