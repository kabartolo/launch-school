    <p>Write a program to determine a studentâ€™s grade based on the average of three scores you get from the user. Use these rules to compute the grade:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the grade is 'A'</li>
      <li>If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 90 then the grade is 'B'</li>
      <li>If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 70 then the grade is 'C'</li>
      <li>If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may assume that all input values are valid positive integers.</p>

    <p>Further exploration: Our solution limits us to exactly three input scores. Modify it to accept any number of scores. To simplify matters, move the computation of the average into a function.</p>
