    <p>Create a function that computes the Greatest Common Divisor of two positive integers.</p>

    <p>Further exploration: The examples all put the larger number first. Do you think the program will still work if you reverse the order and place the smaller number first?</p>

    <p>Our solution works with only two numbers. Can you expand it to accept an array of two or more numbers instead? Hint: the GCD is associative. To compute the GCD of 12, 4, and 8, for instance, you can compute: gcd(12, gcd(4, 8));  // 4 </p>


  <script>
      function gcd(a, b) {
        var temp;

        while (b != 0) {
          temp = b;
          b = a % b;
          a = temp;
        }

        return a;
      }

      console.log(gcd(12, 4));  // 4
      console.log(gcd(15, 10)); // 5
      console.log(gcd(9, 2));   // 1
      console.log(gcd(48, 18)); // 6

      console.log(gcd(12, 4));  // 4
      console.log(gcd(15, 10)); // 5
      console.log(gcd(9, 2));   // 1
      console.log(gcd(18, 48)); // 6

      // Further exploration:
      // This algorithm works whether a > b or b > a. This is because if b > a, the values of a and b will switch after the
      // second step of the algorithm, since the remainder of a smaller number divided by a larger number is the smaller number itself. 
      // For example, with gcd(18, 48), the first step involves setting b to the remainder of a / b, 
      // which is 18 % 48 = 18, so b = 18, and a is set to the value of temp, which is 48, so a = 48.
      // The process continues as for gcd(48, 18).

      // For an array of two or more numbers:
      function gcd(numArray) {
        var a = numArray[0];

        for (var i = 1; i < numArray.length; i++) {  
          var b = numArray[i];
          var temp;
          
          while (b != 0) {
            temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
          }
        }

        return a;
      }

      console.log(gcd([12, 4, 8]));  // 4
      console.log(gcd([25, 100, 50])); // 25
      console.log(gcd([44, 22, 99])); //  11
