# 101 Lesson 3: Medium 2 (23 March 2017)

# 1. Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is
# a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the
# same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood"
# object referred to by a particular named-variable can change
# depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it
# is not always THE SAME object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change
# throughout the flow of the code below:

def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id # => same as a_outer_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."

# fun_with_ids

#2. Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method
# call instead of a block.

# Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the
# block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the
# previous exercise and moved it to a method, to which we are passing
# all of our outer variables.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the
# flow of the code below:

def fun_with_ids
  # Same as above
  a_outer = 42

  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block.\n\n"

  # Everything  printing from inside the method will be the same as in the loop in the above example
  # (except the array and string id's will vary between calls)
  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)

  # The *_outer objects are unchanged before/after the method call since the method does not mutate them or reassign them
  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call.\n\n"

  # The *_inner objects are not available outside the method
  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"

end

# the args are new variables but they point to the same objects as outside
def an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)
  a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id

  # From solution: As before with the block version of this exercise, when we change the values of our "outers", 
  # Ruby uses new objects for these variables to deal with their new values.
  # One important difference to note is that before, we saw Ruby re-using the "42" object and just giving it a new
  # value inside the block. Why the difference? It should become clear a couple of paragraphs later in this solution...

# fun_with_ids

# 3. Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see
# how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# => My string looks like this now: pumpkins
# => My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

# 4. To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string
# show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify
# the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# => "My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga"
# => "My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]"

# 5. How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?
def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

# Solution
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
